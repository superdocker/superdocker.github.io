I am currently in my fifth year of the integrated Ph.D. program in Electronic Engineering at Hanyang University. My research primarily focuses on developing deep learning algorithms for efficient hardware, with an emphasis on the areas of **Quantization on Transformer Model** and **Reduced-Precision Numerical Formats**. Furthermore, I am also interested in sparsity for lightweight AI inference. I conduct my research in the [Artificial Intelligence Hardware and Algorithm Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/aihalab) under the guidance of Prof. [Jungwook Choi](https://scholar.google.co.kr/citations?user=YPT98zwAAAAJ&hl=en).
